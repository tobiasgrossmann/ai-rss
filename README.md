Students can try out ideas and get feedback on them without having to wait days or weeks to get a response from their instructors.\r\nTheir ability to respond quickly is one reason why chatbots are so useful in education, but it’s not the only advantage chatbots have for teachers and students alike.\r\nIn this article, we’ll explore just how great chatbots can be for learning — and show you some of the best tools out there for teachers who want to start using these programs in their classrooms today!\r\n1 What are Chatbots?\r\n2 Why Should Teachers Use Them?\r\n3 AI-Based Chatbots\r\n4 The Best Tools\r\n5 Botsify\r\n6 Mya.ai\r\n7 Replybot\r\n8 How to Create Your Own Bot\r\nChatbots — also known as conversational agents or “bots” — are computer programs that use artificial intelligence algorithms to respond to conversation-based interactions from users. They can be used through a variety of platforms including messaging apps, voice assistants (like Apple’s Siri) and on web pages.\r\nIn the case of chatbot-powered educational applications, these bots can help students practice conversational skills by using AI algorithms to answer their questions or respond to inquiries based on a given topic. They can also offer a way for educators to give feedback more quickly, as well as track and analyze how students are learning.\r\nWhy Should Teachers Use Them?\r\nChatbots are great for teachers because they offer an easy and interactive way for students to practice communication skills with little oversight required from the teacher. Because they can respond more quickly than humans (although not necessarily accurately), chatbots can also help to speed up the feedback loop in a classroom — something that’s always welcome.\r\nTheir ability to interact with students quickly and effectively could be especially useful for"

Can machine learning be trusted to help real people too?: MedPage Today\r\nAI learns how to help diabetes patients – Harvard Gazette\r\nResearchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, in collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that analyzes patient medical records and provides personalized recommendations to clinicians on the best course of treatment. The system has been shown to be effective in helping patients with type 2 diabetes achieve their blood glucose targets by providing treatment guidance based on an analysis of more than 50,000 electronic health record (EHR) patient data points for each patient.\r\nThe study is described today in the journal Science Translational Medicine and builds upon earlier work that demonstrated how the system could be used to make accurate predictions about a patients’ future blood glucose levels by analyzing EHRs. In the current paper, authors demonstrate how this machine-learning tool can help clinicians choose appropriate treatment plans for patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\n“The most important aspect of our AI system is that it learns from patient data and provides personalized treatment guidance,” said Ramsey Badawi, Ph.D., co-lead author on the paper and a former Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering who was also affiliated with Brigham and Womens Hospital during his work at Harvard Medical School. “It makes specific recommendations that are personalized to an individual patient based on their own medical records.”\r\nThe system, dubbed AI-Care, is described in the paper as a “data-driven decision support tool for diabetes treatment” and works by using machine learning to analyze EHRs and determine the best course of treatment for each patient. According to the authors, their work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this system in reducing blood glucose levels in patients over 16 weeks, with recommendations that are personalized for each individual patient.\r\nThe study used data from a large insurance company database to generate EHRs containing information on diabetic patients for more than 30,000 individuals and 287,549 EHR visits over"

        "ai": " are already using generative AI to generate in-game content. Nobody knows who owns it.:\r\nEven the most sophisticated and hardworking artists don’t have the creativity of an artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of generating endless combinations without making a mistake, even if it means repeating itself many times over. This has opened up new horizons for game developers. They can now use AI-generated art to create in-game content more quickly and at a lower cost than with traditional approaches.\r\nThis year, Chinese mobile games company 8th Wonder is using an AI-enabled platform called Groove to generate new levels for its latest game, Fruit Rush, which has already generated more than 30 million downloads. “We’re always on the lookout for ways we can improve our level creation process,” says the company’s co-founder and CEO, Wei Zhu. He adds that AI tools like Groove can generate thousands of levels in just a few hours.\r\nThis kind of innovation is already changing the way many games are made today. According to Andrew Gossen, associate vice president for game design at the New York University Game Center, “AI-generated art and audio will become more common over time as the technology matures.”\r\nBut how can developers be sure that AI-generated works are not infringed? In a world where even AI researchers and scientists have expressed concerns about the potential for abuse of such algorithms, there is no need to worry. “We don’t know who owns it,” says Jason Schultz, co-chair of intellectual property and information technology practice at law firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP. “It could be owned by a company or by an individual; we just don’t know.”\r\nThis is the most important point to remember when dealing with AI generated works: Nobody knows who owns it. And this is the main reason why using AI-generated art and audio in your game project is so tempting — you can save a lot of money and time, especially if your game requires lots of new content all the time.\r\nThe good thing about using AI generated works is that it can create almost endless combinations of levels or game assets without making a mistake.

(The rules are designed to address companies that use algorithms to decide what content should stay up.) But it turns out the problem was larger than simply not wanting to be censored. As we learn in a Bloomberg report, Musk’s real purpose in speaking about this issue is to stop any regulation of online platforms (including his own), full stop.\r\n[…] Musk’s push against the EU regulations follows similar lobbying by other companies in Washington and Brussels that argue overly strict rules could stymie innovation and restrict free speech.\r\nMusk, who has about 23 million Twitter followers and more than 19 million Facebook users, said he doesn’t want to be subjected to the EU regulations, which will require internet companies to remove offensive content in less than 24 hours or face penalties from regulators.\r\n“It should be up to individual platforms to determine what is best for their communities,” Musk said on Twitter last week when asked about his views. “A single set of rules that does not account for a wide variety of content & context (e.g. satire, comedy, parody) can lead to no good outcomes.”\r\nMusk didn't just want the regulation stopped; he wanted it blocked from ever happening again:\r\nMusk […] said that, while he understands the need for tech companies to abide by basic rules when it comes to offensive content, he doesn’t think the EU should have the power to dictate what happens in U.S. social media platforms. “I don’t think Europe should be allowed to tell us what we can say,” Musk said.\r\nThat was, until Twitter started getting some of those regulatory requests:\r\nThe company […"

        "ai": " teachers, and everyone else to know about the ethics of using of AI in education.: Part One\r\nThe recent controversy involving “Project Nightingale” has raised some important questions and concerns that should be addressed. I am not an expert on these issues but my thoughts are outlined below based upon many years working as a teacher, principal and university educator and researcher. I was born in England during World War II. My father served in the British Army in India at the end of the war and when he returned to civilian life he began his teaching career at a state elementary school. He went on to become a headmaster and eventually became an education officer for a county council working with teachers and other educators.\r\nI am writing this article because I have witnessed many changes in the educational landscape, some good others not so much. I think that it is important to recognize that there are no simple solutions. In addition we cannot expect our teachers to be experts across all domains of life. However, as part of their teacher training students should learn about these issues and discuss how they can use the best available evidence from multiple sources to make decisions in response to ethical dilemmas.\r\nI have a concern that AI could change teaching into “teacherless” classes in which students would be taught by algorithms and not real people. I believe this is potentially undesirable for reasons outlined below. However, I am prepared to accept that we should have the appropriate research done as to whether or not this will actually occur and then make decisions based upon those results.\r\nIn my experience, the most important question in education is: “How can teachers best help children learn?” Teachers want to maximize student learning. As teachers they are also parents, relatives and friends who know that they must always put the interests of their own children first. This raises the issue of conflicts of interest as well as issues related to privacy.\r\nThe idea that students could be monitored by AI in schools is problematic because there are many ways to interpret ethical issues based upon different cultures and beliefs, including religious perspectives. I was at a conference where a religious educator stated that he did not believe that AI was the answer for education. He believed that it should be a person who was teaching his children. I do have concerns about this issue but recognize that there are many views on the topic and we need to try"
